Predicting diabetes using machine learning with the Pima Indians dataset

This project uses the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset to predict whether a patient is likely to be diabetic based on features like glucose levels, BMI, insulin, and more.

Steps in the project:
	•	Load and explore the dataset
	•	Handle zero-values in medically impossible fields
	•	Visualize distributions
	•	Perform train-test split and scale features
	•	Train and evaluate classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
	•	Make predictions on new patient data
